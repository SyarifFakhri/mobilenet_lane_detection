"""
WARNING: this code is destructive. It overides the dataset when it standardizes, so make sure
you keep a backup of the raw dataset before you run.
This code actually does a few things.
1. It normalizes the data set to have 0 mean and unit std deviation
2. It removes all unnescessary labels and only puts labels relevant to regression
3. It removes any data that doesn't contain the center lane

This data extracts the center lane from the CULane dataset
